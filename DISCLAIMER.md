# PLEASE NOTE
This app is entirely written by Claude Code.  I asked it to take the Python-based CHIRP application and port it to rust.  The rationale was that I was having trouble getting a Python environment configured exactly right to test a PR I was making into the CHIRP repository.  Out of frustration, I decided I'd test out Claude Code's abilities.

$100 and a few days later and the app works -- for me.  It may not work at all for you.  

If you are looking for a fantastic project, check out [CHIRP](https://www.chirpmyradio.com).  I would not start here, in my ai-rendered fever-dream reimagining.
